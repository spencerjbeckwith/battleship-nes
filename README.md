Simple 1 or 2-player Battleship game for NES.

## Build the ROM

To build the ROM, you will need the following tools installed and available in your `PATH`:

- [cc65 (for ca65 and ld65)](https://cc65.github.io/getting-started.html)
- [neschr](https://github.com/spencerjbeckwith/neschr)

Once these tools are installed, run `make`. Running `make clean` will remove all output files.
